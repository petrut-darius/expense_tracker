hello, this is a ruby project, that i did in my informatics class.
It's using the pgAdmin 4 database. It is not perfect but id does what i wanted to.
It is a expense tracker, you can see in the index.rb file the things you need to write to use the classes.
The Minus class get's the sum of all the entries in the table, same does the Plus class.
The InsertMinus insert's values in the minus tabel in the database, same does the InsertPlus.
The CreateUser class insert's the information about the user in the info tabel in the database.
There is a module folder, in which is the connection to the database.
There is a slr.rb file which I used to do some testing.
